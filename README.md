This package implements Transition Identifiers / Early Warning Signals / Resilience Indicators / Regime Shift Identifiers, or however else you want to call them!

It is currently WIP, and will become part of [DynamicalSystems.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/DynamicalSystems.jl) once it is ready.

In the meantime, see https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/DynamicalSystems.jl/issues/194
